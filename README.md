# OLook

## Overview
OLook is an application made in 48 hours during the [HackSherbrooke](http://hacksherbrooke.com/) 2016. The goal was to create a platform that would help newly arrived and established Sherbrooke citizens find points of interest in their city.

## How does it work?
OLook tracks your current location in real-time. It then fetches information from publicly avaible databases about the city and displays that information on a conveninent map. Filters help you find quickly the points of interest that suit your needs.

When you click on a point of interest, you get more information about it including indications on how to find it physically.

In the future, the points of interest woulod be displayed as a camera overlay to create a kind of augmented reality.
